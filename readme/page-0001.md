This application uses the `rebing/graphql-laravel` package to enable the front-end framework to interact using GraphQL.

### Installation

1. Install the `rebing/graphql-laravel` package using Composer:

   ```bash
   composer require rebing/graphql-laravel
   ```

2. The package will publish its configuration file to `config/graphql.php`.

### Configuration

The `config/graphql.php` file defines your GraphQL schema and endpoints.

Here's a breakdown of the important settings:

- **`schemas`**: This defines your GraphQL schemas. You can have multiple named schemas.

  ```php
  'schemas' => [
      'default' => DefaultSchema::class,
  ],
  ```

- **`schema`**: (Optional) If you don't define named schemas, you can define the default schema class directly here.

- **`http`**: This configures the GraphQL HTTP endpoint. By default, it's set to `/graphql`.

  ```php
  'http' => [
      'path' => '/graphql',
      'methods' => ['GET', 'POST'],
  ],
  ```

- **`middleware`**: You can define middleware to be applied to GraphQL requests.
