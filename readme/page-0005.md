# Task Deletion API Documentation

### Task Deletion Mutation
To delete an existing task, use the following mutation:

```graphql
mutation DeleteTask {
  deleteTask(id: "2", user_id: "1")
}
```

### Mutation Details
- **Mutation Name:** `DeleteTask`
- **Parameters:**
  - `id` (String): The unique identifier of the task to be deleted.
  - `user_id` (String): The ID of the user requesting the task deletion.

### Example Mutation
```graphql
mutation DeleteTask {
